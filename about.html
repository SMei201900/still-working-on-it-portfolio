    <h1>Hello, my name is ---</h1>
    <p>My name is ---. pronounced the same way as that famous student loan company <a href="">Sally Mae</a>" but spelled differently. 
    </br> 
    I am a recent graduate from <a href="">CUNY Hunter College</a> with a bachelor's in human biology and
    am an incoming student to <a href="">Western Governor's University</a> where I am slated to study computer science.
    <br>
    Outside of my academics, I love watching animes, dramas and movies along and reading their source materials aka books and mangas.
