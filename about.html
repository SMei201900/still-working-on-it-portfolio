    <h1>Hello, my name is ---</h1>
    <h2>Hello Sally! </h2> 
    
    <p> I specialize in data analysis and web development, with a keen interest in UX/UI design. Currently, I’m studying UX design through Google’s Coursera program and working on web development certifications from FreeCodeCamp and IBM. I love merging design, data, and tech to create seamless, user-centered digital experiences.
